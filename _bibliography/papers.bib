  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract={The origin of birds from non-avian theropod dinosaur ancestors required a comprehensive restructuring of the body plan to enable the evolution of powered flight. One of the proposed key mechanisms that allowed birds to acquire flight and modify the associated anatomical structures into diverse forms is mosaic evolution, which describes the parcelization of phenotypic traits into separate modules that evolve with heterogeneous tempo and mode. Avian mosaicism has been investigated with a focus on the cranial and appendicular skeleton, and as such, we do not understand the role of the axial column in avian macroevolution. The long, flexible neck of extant birds lies between the cranial and pectoral modules and represents an opportunity to study the contribution of the axial skeleton to avian mosaicism.},

  abstract = {The neck is a critical portion of the avian spine, one that works in tandem with the beak to act as a surrogate forelimb and allows birds to manipulate their surroundings despite the lack of a grasping capable hand. Birds display an incredible amount of diversity in neck morphology across multiple anatomical scales—from varying cervical counts down to intricate adaptations of individual vertebrae. Despite this morphofunctional disparity, little is known about the drivers of this enormous variation, nor how neck evolution has shaped avian macroevolution. To promote interest in this system, I review the development, function and evolution of the avian cervical spine. The musculoskeletal anatomy, basic kinematics and development of the avian neck are all documented, but focus primarily upon commercially available taxa. In addition, recent work has quantified the drivers of extant morphological variation across the avian neck, as well as patterns of integration between the neck and other skeletal elements. However, the evolutionary history of the avian cervical spine, and its contribution to the diversification and success of modern birds is currently unknown. Future work should aim to broaden our understanding of the cervical anatomy, development and kinematics to include a more diverse selection of extant birds, while also considering the macroevolutionary drivers and consequences of this important section of the avian spine.},

  abstract={It is accepted that non-avian theropod dinosaurs, with their long muscular tails and small forelimbs, had a centre-of-mass close to the hip, while extant birds, with their reduced tails and enlarged wings have their mass centred more cranially. Transition between these states is considered crucial to two key innovations in the avian locomotor system: crouched bipedalism and powered flight. Here we use image-based models to challenge this dichotomy. Rather than a phylogenetic distinction between ‘dinosaurian’ and ‘avian’ conditions, we find terrestrial versus volant taxa occupy distinct regions of centre-of-mass morphospace consistent with the disparate demands of terrestrial bipedalism and flight. We track this decoupled evolution of body shape and mass distribution through bird evolution, including the origin of centre-of-mass positions more advantageous for flight and major reversions coincident with terrestriality. We recover modularity in the evolution of limb proportions and centre-of-mass that suggests fully crouched bipedalism evolved after powered flight.},

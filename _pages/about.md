I'm an evolutionary biologist and palaentologist hailing from [Stoke-on-Trent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOnqBFYSQK0) in the UK. I use multifaceted approach to combine 3D shape analysis with phylogenetic comparative methods and functional morphology to understand the evolution of form and function of the vertebrate skeleton across time and clades. I'm passionate about my science and about making it inclusive for everyone üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà

The vertebral column is the defining feature of vertebrate skeleton, supporting the entire skeleton of over 50,000 species, so I've made it the defining feature of my career. My current <s>obsession</s> focus is on the evolution of the neck in birds and dinosaurs (see the [Projects](https://ryndmrk.github.io/projects/) page for more details).

I'd love to hear from you if you have some cool collaboration ideas. Email me or DM me on Twitter using the icons at the bottom of the page!

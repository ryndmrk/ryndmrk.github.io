I'm an evolutionary biologist and palaentologist hailing from Stoke-on-Trent in the UK. I use multifaceted approach to combine 3D shape analysis with phylogenetic comparative methods and functional morphology to understand the evolution of form and function across time and clades. I'm passionate about my science and about making it inclusive for everyone üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà

The vertebral column is the defining feature of vertebrates, supporting the entire skeleton of over 50,000 species, so I've made it the defining feature of my career. My current <s>obsession</s> focus is on the evolution of the neck in birds and dinosaurs (see the [Projects](https://ryndmrk.github.io/projects/) page for more details).
